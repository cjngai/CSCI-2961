Lab 2 - Christopher Ngai - 9/11/15

1. I read the four criteria for Free Software. They are as follows: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
2. It is important to choose a license in order for the owner of a project to be able to define how they wish to distribute their product. By choosing an open source license, the product will have its freedom of use, distribution, and reuse standardized to the Open Source Initiative's Definition.
3. By using a product that doesn't have an explicit license, a user runs into potential legal trouble. This is because the lack of a license actually means that the property is the most restricted, with all rights reserved for the creator only.
4. I agree with this claim. It seems as though the Gopher project was too restricted by its lack of freedoms that open source projects thrive with, such as freedom to edit and redistribute, as well as a lack of community support due to more commercial policies like licensing fees.
5. Microsoft's .NET Core uses MIT license because it gives people the ability to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the software without limit, provided that Microsoft is not held liable for any results of those usages. This works well within Microsoft's frequent licensing of commercial software because they are free to use their own .NET Core to do with what they wish in interacting with their restricted software, while they can also allow anyone else to develop in .NET as well.
6-8 were done in the group during class.
9. Sumit Munshi, Aman Zargarpur, Alvin Leung, Helen Lei, and I will be working on a project together. We will be in contact during class. We plan to work on a Chrome Extension. We'd like to use MIT. Further details to be decided.
